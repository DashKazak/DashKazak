- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DashKazak, a software developer and a data analyst. I work as an IT professional. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development and data analytics. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python programming and data analytics with Jupyter Notebook as well as JavaScript with Node.js and Vue. 
- I am looking for new opportunities to collaborate and building my own projects. My current project is an app that will solve my problem of not wanting to cook at home: 
- I kept a log of foods I don't get tired of and can cook very well. I also collected data on ingredients of each dish. My app will help me keep track of what ingredients I have and what dishes I can cook at a point in time. My goal is to waste less food and eat at home more frequently.
